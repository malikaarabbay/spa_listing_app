#  VILT SPA — Laravel 11 + Vue 3 + Inertia.js + Tailwind CSS

This is a modern full-stack Single Page Application (SPA) boilerplate built with the **VILT** stack — **Laravel 11**, **Inertia.js**, **Vue 3**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

It demonstrates how to structure a full-stack SPA without a separate API layer, using Inertia.js to seamlessly connect the Laravel backend with a Vue 3 frontend. The project includes authentication, routing, dynamic components, responsive design, and clean development practices.

## ⚙️ Stack

- **Laravel 11** – backend logic, routing, database, authentication
- **Inertia.js** – bridges Laravel and Vue without API/JSON overhead
- **Vue 3 (Composition API)** – frontend interactivity and components
